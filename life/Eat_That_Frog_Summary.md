As you can imagine, the book is bursting with fantastic insights. In these notes, we’ll cover just a few of my favourites.

Let’s jump straight in.

## Key Insights:
### The Frogs and Why To Eat Them

```python
“Mark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction
of knowing that that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long.

Your “frog” is your biggest, most important task, the one you are most likely to procrastinate on if you don’t do something about it. It is
also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and results at the moment.”
```

This concept is brilliant, and it’s all about building the habit of tackling the most difficult task first thing in the morning. To be productive, we must resist the temptation to do easy tasks first.

Now, most of us procrastinate. Why? Because we’re inherently lazy—our brains are wired to avoid hard things. That’s what the Nobel-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman described as “the law of the least effort.”

That’s why important tasks often migrate from one to-do list to another until we’re forced to act under pressure. The key to being productive in life and work is to discipline yourself to do the hardest tasks before moving on to something else.

So here is the **Eat That Frog concept** in its essence:
```python
“The key to reaching high levels of performance and productivity is to develop the lifelong habit of tackling your major task first thing
each morning. You must develop the routine of “eating your frog” before you do anything else and without taking too much time to think about it.”
```

**Question for you:** What is your number one task for today? How are you getting on?

That leads us to the next insight.

### Habits For Success
```python
“Your success in life and work will be determined by the kinds of habits that you develop over time. The habit of setting priorities,
overcoming procrastination, and getting on with your most important task is a mental and physical skill. As such, this habit is learnable
through practice and repetition, over and over again, until it locks into your subconscious mind and becomes a permanent part of your behavior.
Once it becomes a habit, it becomes both automatic and easy to do.”
```

Habits are the building blocks of success. They’re like the scaffolding that supports your goals. If you want to boost your productivity, you need to pay close attention to your habits.

First step? Develop three key qualities: **decision, discipline, and determination:**
```python
“First, make a decision to develop the habit of task completion. Second, discipline yourself to practice the principles you are about
to learn over and over until they become automatic. And third, back everything you do with determination until the habit is locked in
and becomes a permanent part of your personality.”
```

Now, let’s have a quick look at the 21 Productivity Habits.

P.S.: If you want to learn how to build great habits, I strongly recommend checking out our notes on [Atomic Habits](https://github.com/ngasajr/book_summaries/blob/main/life/Atomic_Habits_Summary.md) by James Clear and The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy.


### 21 Productivity Habits

In the book, Tracy dedicates each chapter to one of the 21 Productivity Habits. Here they are in a nutshell:

**1. Set the Table.**
Know what you want. Write out your goals before you even start.

**2. Plan Each Day in Advance.**
Don’t go with a flow – plan it out. Every minute you spend planning saves you ten in execution.

**3. Apply the 80/20 Rule to Everything.**
20 per cent of your tasks get you 80 per cent of your results. Focus on that crucial 20 per cent.

**4. Consider the Consequences.**
Your most important tasks and priorities are those that have the most serious consequences on your life and work. Focus on these above anything else.

**5. Practice Creative Procrastination.**
Procrastinate on the low-value tasks, so you can tackle the ones that matter..

**6. Use the ABCDE Method Continually.**
Before you start, rank your tasks by value and priority to stay focused on what’s important.

**7. Focus On Key Result Areas.**
Know what results you need to nail your job and work on them all day.

**8. Apply The Law Of Three.**
Identify the three things you do in your work that account for 90 per cent of your contribution, and focus on getting them done before any other task.

**9. Prepare Thoroughly Before You Begin.**
Have everything ready to go before you start. Gather all your info, papers, and materials so you can hit the ground running.

**10. Take It One Step at a Time.**
Break big tasks into smaller, manageable steps and focus on progress.

**11. Upgrade Your Key Skills.**
The better you get at your main tasks, the quicker you’ll get them done.

**12. Leverage Your Special Talents.**
Know your strengths and focus on excelling at them.

**13. Identify Your Key Constraints.**
Find the bottlenecks slowing you down and work on fixing them.

**14. Put The Pressure On Yourself.**
Create urgency. Pretend you’re about to leave town for a long holiday and must finish your most important tasks before you go.

**15. Maximize Your Personal Powers.**
Know your peak times for mental and physical energy and tackle your most important tasks then.

**16. Motivate Yourself Into Action.**
Be your own cheerleader. Develop optimism and focus on the solution rather than the problem.

**17. Stop Technological Time Sinks.**
Make technology work for you, not the other way around. Turn off your devices occasionally.

**18. Slice And Dice The Task.**
Break complex tasks into bite-sized pieces, then start with one small part.

**19. Create Large Chunks Of Time.**
Organize your days into time blocks for deep work on important tasks.

**20. Develop A Sense Of Urgency.**
Get into the habit of moving fast on your top tasks.

**21. Single-Handle Every Task.**
```python
“Set clear priorities, start immediately on your most important task, and then work without stopping until the job is 100 percent
complete. This is the real key to high performance and maximum personal productivity.”
```

If you’re nodding along – awesome. Now comes the hard part – actually implementing these habits.

Here’s a challenge for you: pick three habits that you think will make the most positive impact on your life and try them out. You can use James Clear’s habit formation framework from his great book Atomic Habits.

Let’s dive into a few of my favourites.

**Set The Table**
```python
“Before you can determine your “frog” and get on with the job of eating it, you have to decide exactly what you want to achieve in each
area of your life. Clarity is perhaps the most important concept in personal productivity. The number one reason why some people get more
work done faster is because they are absolutely clear about their goals and objectives, and they don’t deviate from them. The greater clarity
you have regarding what you want and the steps you will have to take to achieve it, the easier it will be for you to overcome procrastination,
eat your frog, and complete the task before you.”
```

Get this – people who write down their goals achieve way more than those who just… don’t. Like, way more. We’re talking five to ten times more. Now, that sounds crazy, right?

Here’s the thing: writing down your goals isn’t some mystical ritual that grants wishes. It’s more like a punch in the face to your procrastination monster. By putting your goals on paper (or your phone, whatever floats your boat), you’re forcing yourself to get clear on what you actually want. No more fuzzy daydreams, it’s time to get specific.

And let’s be honest, seeing your goals written down in black and white can be a real motivator. It’s like a constant reminder of what you’re working towards. It’s the difference between saying, “I want to get in shape,” and staring down a training plan that says, “Day 1: 20 pushups, go!”

But guess what? Writing your goals down isn’t a guarantee of success. You have to take action, too. Tracy breaks it down into seven steps:

- **Step 1:** Decide exactly what you want.
- **Step 2:** Write it down.
- **Step 3:** Set a deadline for your goal; set subheadlines if necessary.
- **Step 4:** Make a list of everything that you can think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal.
- **Step 5:** Organize the list into a plan.
- **Step 6:** Take action on your plan immediately.
- **Step 7:** Resolve to do something every single day that moves you toward your major goal.
  
Now it’s your turn – what do you want to achieve? Write it down and start making moves toward your most important goal.

## Key Takeaways from Atomic Habits by James Clear

1.Focus on making tiny adjustments to your behavior, as **small changes lead to lasting improvements**

2.Strategically use the **habit loop–cue, craving, response, and reward**–to build a new habit

3.**Align your habits with the identity you want to build**, and let your habits reinforce the person you aspire to be

4.**Integrate a new habit into an existing routine.** Existing cues and human behavior make it easier to establish and maintain new habits 

5.**Have patience**, as the progress in habit formation is often not immediately visible 

6.**Design your environment** to support habit formation 

7.Breaking down habits into **two-minute tasks** makes them more manageable 

8.Habit formation is an ongoing process of continuous improvement. So, be willing to **adjust your habits as circumstances change**

## Forming Good Habits: A Breakdown of Atomic Habits’ 4 Laws

Clear’s four laws of human behavior change stem from the concept of the Habit Loop. This loop comprises four stages:

    1.Cue 
    2.Craving
    3.Response
    4.Reward

**Stage 1 – Cue:** The cue acts as the trigger, initiating the good habit loop, and can be anything from a specific time to an emotional state. 

**Stage 2 – Craving:** Following the cue, there is a craving—a motivational force representing the desire for the reward associated with the habit.

**Stage 3 – Response:** The response is the actual behavior or action performed in response to the cue and craving, constituting the habit itself.

**Stage 4 – Reward:** Finally, the reward is the positive outcome or satisfaction resulting from completing the habit, reinforcing the loop, and increasing the likelihood of habit repetition.

Based on these four steps, Clear created four laws that help you build a successful habit loop. In each law, he gives three to four tactics for habit-building and one tactic to break it. 

Let’s see how we can use both aspects to enhance productivity. 

## Law #1: Make it obvious
Are you aware of the habits you must build and break? If not, there’s no way you can train your mind to act a certain way. 

You see, human minds act on cues and bad habits repeat. When you experience something repeatedly, your reaction to it becomes natural. There’s a cue that gives your brain a signal to act a certain way, and your behavior or response becomes automatic. 

As Clear mentions, *“Museum curators have been known to discern the difference between an authentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit even though they can’t tell you precisely which details tipped them off.”*

Why? Because they have been repeatedly identifying authentic art for years. 

The little gaps become so relevant that a single glance catches it. 

We might not think it’s real, but invisible cues trigger their minds. To pick up on these cues and automate behaviors, you’ve got to become more aware. Here are some ways to do this:

**1. Habit scorecards**

A habit scorecard is like a checklist where you jot down your daily activities. Then, you figure out if each habit is positive, negative, or neutral in its impact.

The goal of your habit scorecard is to gain awareness and identify patterns contributing to or hindering progress.

Creating it is simple; all you need to do is:
- List your regular daily activities at work or home
- Categorize each activity as positive, negative, or neutral
- Rate each habit based on its overall impact
- Understand how your current behaviors affect productivity

Let's put this into action.

| Time    | Activity                                     | Rating |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------|--------|
| 9:00 am | Review and set daily priorities               | 4      |
| 10:00 am| Begin working on high-priority tasks          | 4      |
| 12:00 pm| Lunch break                                   | 5      |
| 1:00 pm | Check progress on tasks, adjust the plan      | 3      |
| 2:00 pm | Attend team meeting                           | 4      |
| 3:00 pm | Continue working on tasks                     | 5      |
| 6:00 pm | Wrap up work for the day                      | 3      |
| 8:00 pm | Submit completed tasks by the deadline        | 2      |

Look at the lowest score— submit completed tasks by the deadline (2). Now, observe how the tasks related to your submissions also have a low score. 

If you want to change this and submit your tasks on time, you need to: 

- Work more on high-priority tasks 
- Check progress and adjust plans 
- Reflect on the day and make better plans for tomorrow
- Wrap up the tasks you set for today

If not, you will continue to miss deadlines, and the burden will shift to the next day. 

**2. Implementation intention**

Implementation intention involves planning when and where to take specific actions to reach your goals.

First, spot the gap in your existing habits. For instance, in the example mentioned earlier, you finish the task but don’t allocate time for reflecting on the day.

Now, set a goal like this—*“I will reflect on my day and plan for tomorrow at 5 PM.”* 

Secondly, you can use habit stacking, a technique to pair a new habit with an existing one. For example, *“After I am done working on my current tasks, I will reflect on the priority tasks I couldn’t complete.”*

Lastly, induce the cues of better habits in your environment. As Clear states, *“..motivation is overrated; the environment often matters more.”* 

If you want to reflect on your goals better, look for goal-tracking apps that help you keep up with your progress. You can also set a vision board that compels you to take action. 

**3. Breaking a bad habit–make it invisible**

Do you know that people with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations? 

They reduce exposure to the cue that causes bad habits, to eliminate them. 

For example, you wait for the day to end to go out for a drink, spend time with your spouse, or do something productive. But towards the end of the day, you find yourself browsing through social media.

In this scenario, you must distance yourself from these cues (your phone) until you do what you intend to do. Make it a pact not to use social media before planning the next day. 

Keep your phone silent and eliminate any other distractions in your environment as a part of your time management strategies. 

## Law #2: Make it attractive
In his second law, Clear mentions that habits operate on a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Put simply, when dopamine goes up, so does the urge to take action. The anticipation of rewards is so powerful that it pushes you to act. 

Clear suggests the use of **temptation bundling** to achieve that. In this technique, you pair up an action you want to do with an action you need to do. 

**Temptation building strategy**

Let’s say you aim to minimize distractions and stay focused during work. But you also want to watch a podcast you love. 

Here’s what you can do:

- Designate specific time blocks for focused work (e.g., 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM)
- Listen to one episode of the podcast you love when you take a break at 11 AM

For instance, commit to 90 minutes of focused work on your marketing report. Take a 20-minute break, during which you can watch the podcast. 

This way, you train your mind to work consistently for 90 minutes before you get to do what you want. 

**Combine habit stacking with temptation bundling**

Clear also suggests combining two techniques to enhance your productivity. 

Here’s the formula:

After (*CURRENT HABIT*), I will (*HABIT I NEED*) 

After (*HABIT I NEED*), I will (*HABIT I WANT*)

It looks something like this: 

*After lunch, I will work on my marketing reports for 90 minutes.* 

*After working for 90 minutes, I will watch one episode of my favorite podcast.* 

Another crucial aspect that helps is surrounding yourself with the right tribe. If you hang out with people who hate their jobs, you will start hating your job, too. 

But if you hang out with a crowd discussing progress, motivation, and goals, you will likely reflect on yours and set the bar higher for yourself. 

**Breaking bad habits–reprogramming your mind**

Now, let’s talk about breaking the bad habits we’ve built over the years. 

Let’s say you wake up at nine every morning and you have to leave to work at 10. You’ve been trying to break this loop and want to wake up early. 

So you keep telling yourself, *“I have to wake up at 5 AM, but I’m unable to.”* 

With a little shift in attitude, you can break this habit–replace have to with get to. 

“I get to wake up at 5 AM every morning and feel the pleasant breeze, exercise, and reflect on my personal goals.” 

The idea is to associate hard habits with positive experiences. How will starting the day at the right pace make you feel? Make it so attractive that your body craves those experiences. 

This change in perspective is so powerful, you’ll find it mentioned in many books on focus. 

## Law #3: Make it easy

*“The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.”*

The more you repeat a habit, the more your brain gets used to it. The structure of your brain changes and you become efficient in it. It is scientifically proven that repeating a habit leads to physical changes in the brain. 

Clear further states, *“The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.”*

**The law of least effort**

We as humans naturally gravitate towards the things that require the least effort. 

That’s where an environment shift helps. You need to create an environment where **doing the hard thing** is **as easy as possible.** 

Let’s say you introduce a new project management software in your organization. The old system, though outdated, is familiar and requires minimal effort. 

In this scenario, the law of least effort is evident as employees may resist the change. 

That’s where you can make the shift easy with training sessions, user-friendly guidelines, and a dedicated support team to address issues. 

Here, you make the environment conducive to learning and maximize the perceived difficulty of adopting the new system. Such changes lead to lasting work habits where employees welcome change with open arms. 

**The two-minute rule**

Our brain is programmed to avoid doing difficult things. 

Throughout our days, we make many decisions. For example, the decision to complete your work or watch another episode of your favorite series on Netflix. 

Clear states that habits are immediate actions. For instance, you take a cab to the gym every day. The habit is taking the cab, not hitting the gym. Habits are the entry point, not the endpoint. 

When starting a new habit, Clear suggests you should follow the two-minute rule. Anything new you take up, shouldn’t take longer than two minutes. 

Now, you might think that’s ridiculous, but you can break down any habit into a two minute-version: 

- If you want to build a reading habit, you can start with reading one page a day 
- If you want to start doing yoga for 30 minutes, you can start by taking out the yoga mat
- Or, in our project management example, you can put the shortcut software on your employees’ desktop so they can quickly log in 

This two-minute version makes you realize that starting is pretty easy. And you take away the power of hard habits. Such tactics are often mentioned and practiced in some of the most popular growth hacking books. 

The takeaway? Start a gateway habit that takes you down to a more productive path. 

**Breaking bad habits–make it impractical**

Clear states that to break habits, you need to make them impractical. 

Technology plays a significant role here. Let’s say you spend excessive time on social media during work hours. You can install an app blocker that automates social media blocking during certain hours. 

As the tool restricts access to social media sites, it makes it impractical (or even impossible!) for you to engage in the habit during those hours. 

## Law #4: Make it satisfying 

You are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. Clear says that we, as humans, are conditioned to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. 

While building great abs on the first day of gymming sounds impossible, there is another way to look at it. 

**The cardinal rule of behavior change**

*“What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.”* 

To make habits inevitable, you need to feel successful immediately in some way. 

If you put the above laws into practice—making things obvious, appealing, and effortless—you’re more likely to carry out the behavior.

But what if you do it only that one time? 

That’s where making it satisfying increases the likelihood of doing it again.  

Let’s say you’ve set a goal to exercise regularly. After each workout, you treat yourself to a healthy smoothie or a favorite snack. By rewarding yourself with something enjoyable after exercising, you make the activity satisfying. 

As a result, you’re more inclined to repeat the workout routine because you link it with a positive and satisfying experience. The idea is to associate immediate pleasures to continue moving towards your big goals. 

**Habit tracker**

Imagine you’re convinced you’re making progress, but suddenly, you find yourself feeling lost and confused without realizing how it happened.

A habit tracker can be a lifesaver. It helps you monitor your progress with new habits. By visualizing and measuring these habits, you get solid proof of your progress. It creates a streak where you keep working on the habits you’re building. 

**Breaking bad habits–get an accountability partner**

Having an accountability partner is great because they offer support, encouragement, and a sense of responsibility. Sharing goals with someone who checks in on our progress boosts motivation and keeps us committed to our objectives.

Knowing that someone else is aware of our goals and holds us accountable can provide a sense of external motivation to stay on track and avoid slacking off or falling back into old habits.

## Popular Atomic Habits Quotes

- *“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”*

- “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”*

- *“Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.”*

- *“You do it because it’s who you are, and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.”*
 
- *“You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.”*


Clear outlines the **Four Laws of Behavior Change** as a framework for building good habits and breaking bad ones:

1. **Make it Obvious**: Identify and clearly define the habits you want to develop or eliminate.
2. **Make it Attractive**: Associate positive feelings with the habits you wish to adopt.
3. **Make it Easy**: Simplify the process of habit formation by reducing friction and making the desired behavior straightforward to perform.
4. **Make it Satisfying**: Ensure that the habit provides immediate rewards to reinforce its continuation.

The book emphasizes the importance of focusing on **systems rather than goals**. By optimizing daily routines and processes, individuals can create an environment conducive to positive habits. Clear also discusses the role of identity in habit formation, suggesting that adopting the identity of the person you want to become can facilitate lasting behavioral change.

Throughout *Atomic Habits*, Clear provides practical strategies and real-life examples to illustrate how small changes can lead to remarkable results. The book serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand and improve their habits systematically.
