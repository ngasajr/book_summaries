## Introduction

Stress, with its significant negative impacts on health, has become a critical social concern, making early detection essential for effective management. The paper presents a deep learning approach for stress detection using multimodal physiological signals, specifically ECG and EDA. The novelty lies in the hierarchical autoencoder (AE) feature fusion in the frequency domain, combined with a CRNN-SE model.

**Takeaway**: The work demonstrates improved stress detection through hierarchical autoencoder-based feature extraction, particularly for subject-independent analysis.

## Methodology

### Datasets

Four datasets were used: ASCERTAIN, CLAS, MAUS, and WAUC, each varying in data collection methods and participant tasks.

### Feature Engineering

- **DCT for Raw Data**: Conversion to the frequency domain.
- **Frequency Band Features**: PSD estimation with Welch's method, extracting 51 ECG and 40 EDA statistical features.

### Model Architecture

The hierarchical autoencoder extracted latent features, and the CRNN-SE model processed these for stress classification.

**Takeaway**: The combined use of hierarchical features and CRNN-SE enabled robust feature extraction and classification.

### Cost Function Comparison

MSE outperformed KL divergence and cosine similarity.

### Frequency Band vs. Raw Data

Frequency band features performed better by 4-8%.

### Generalizability

Consistent results across all datasets.

**Takeaway**: The method outperforms existing models, proving its efficacy and generalizability.
